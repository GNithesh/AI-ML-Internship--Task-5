# Decision Trees & Random Forests

## 📌 Objective
Implement Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers, visualize trees, analyze overfitting, and evaluate model performance.

## 📊 Dataset
Heart Disease Dataset (Kaggle).

## ⚙️ Steps
1. Train a Decision Tree and visualize it.
2. Tune depth to avoid overfitting.
3. Train a Random Forest and compare accuracy.
4. Interpret feature importance.
5. Evaluate using cross-validation.

## 📈 Results
Random Forest achieved better accuracy and stability compared to a single Decision Tree.
